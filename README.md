# NXNE Interactive Audio-Visual Sketch

This project is an interactive audio-visual experience created using p5.js and p5.sound.js for [NXNE Music Festival](https://www.nxne.com/). 
It combines user interaction, audio-driven animations, and visual effects to create a dynamic canvas. Users can upload images and audio, manipulate 
various parameters to produce unique visual compositions. The sketch is also equipped with playback and recording functionality. It records the p5 canvas,
exports it as .webm, using CloudConvert API converts the file into an mp4 and generates a download link.
